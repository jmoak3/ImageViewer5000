For a little AR experiment involving 3D movie glasses, tape, hats, and phones.

It renders an input mesh in space relative to real life. 

If you turn away, the mesh will stay in the same spot.
This allows you  to put a dragon mesh on a table and only see it when you turn your head and face that table.

See it in all of its goofy glory:
